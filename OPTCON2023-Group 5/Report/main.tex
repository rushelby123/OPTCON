This project addresses the optimal control of a planar quadrotor with a suspended load. Tasks involve dynamics discretization, trajectory generation through the Newton's method algorithm, trajectory tracking via Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Model Predictive Control (MPC).
Finally, the quadrotor movement will be shown in an animation.

%%%%%%%%%% Introduction %%%%%%%%%%
\chapter*{Introduction}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Introduction}

In this project, we are required to design an optimal trajectory for a quadrotor with a suspended load. 

The project consists of four main steps:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Task 0 - Problem Setup:
Discretization of the quadrotor dynamics and writing of the iscrete-time state-space equations.
  \item Task 1 - Trajectory Generation I:
Design of an optimal trajectory to move from one equilibrium configuration to another, using a Newton's like algorithm.
  \item Task 2 - Trajectory Generation II:
Generation of a desired (smooth) state$-$input curve and
application of the trajectory generation task (Task 1) on this new desired trajectory.
    \item Task 3 - Trajectory Tracking via LQR:
Linearization of the model around the optimal trajectory obtained in the previous point and definition of the optimal feedback controller to perform trajectory tracking through LQR algorithm.
    \item Task 4 - Trajectory
tracking via MPC: Exploitation of an MPC algorithm to track the optimal trajectory $(x_{opt}, u_{opt})$ computed in Task 2 linearizing the vehicle dynamics about it.
    \item Task 5 - Animation:
Producing a simple animation of the vehicle executing Task 3.
\end{itemize}

With the realization of this project we solved different tasks and were able to design an optimal control for a planar quadrotor with suspended load.

\begin{itemize}
    \item In the first task, a Newton's like algorithm was implemented to design the
optimal trajectoy allowing to follow a step reference to move from one equilibrium configuration to another. In order to do this, the Armijo algorithm for step size selection was exploited.
    \item In the second task we exploited again the Newton's like algorithm to design an optimal
trajectory between two equilibria, but with a reference curve designed as a sigmoid function.
    \item In the third task we used the LQR method to follow the optimal trajectory
designed in task 2. Furthermore, we proved that the controller is able
to achieve the target starting with perturbed initial conditions.
    \item In the fourth task we applied the MPC algorithm to track the
optimal trajectory designed in task 2 and we proved again that the controller is able to achieve the target starting with perturbed initial conditions.

\end{itemize}
