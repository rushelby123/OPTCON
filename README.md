# OPTCON
Optimal Control assignment, for a full project description check the report.

##Abstract
This project addresses the optimal control of a planar quadrotor with a
suspended load. Tasks involve dynamics discretization, trajectory
generation through the Newtonâ€™s method algorithm, trajectory tracking
via Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Model Predictive Control
(MPC). Finally, the quadrotor movement will be shown in an animation
